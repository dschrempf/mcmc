* Markov chain Monte Carlo

#+html: <p align="center"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/dschrempf/mcmc.svg?branch=master"/></p>

Sample from a posterior using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

At the moment, the library is tailored to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
since it covers most use cases. However, implementation of more algorithms is
planned in the future.

** Documentation
The [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mcmc][source code]] contains detailed documentation about general concepts as well
as specific functions.

** Examples
Have a look at the [[https://github.com/dschrempf/mcmc/tree/master/mcmc-examples][example MCMC analyses]]. They can be built with [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][Stack]] and are
attached to this repository.
#+name: Build
#+begin_src sh :exports code :results none
git clone https://github.com/dschrempf/mcmc.git
cd mcmc
stack build
#+end_src

For example, estimate the [[https://github.com/dschrempf/mcmc/blob/master/mcmc-examples/Archery/Archery.hs][accuracy of an archer]] with
#+name: Archery
#+begin_src sh :exports code :results none
stack exec archery
#+end_src
