For the test case, see
- the [[file:~/Evolutionary-Biology/Code/revbayes/revbayes.github.io/tutorials/relative_time_constraints/][RevBayes tutorial about relative time constraints]],
- and the [[file:~/Shared/haskell/mcmc/mcmc-examples/PhylogeneticLikelihoodMultivariate/data-test/][test data of the MCMC sampler]].

The test is very promising! The Haskell MCMC sampler seems to perform equally
well as the RevBayes version. I don't think I can hope for more :).

The screenshot shows the original time tree on the left side, the RevBayes MAP
tree on the top right, and the MCMC MAP tree on the bottom right.
