* Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling - ChangeLog
** Unreleased changes
- Improve documentation.

*** mcmc-tree
- Remove parallel branch prior. Improve speed of sequential branch prior.
- Remove unsafe suffix of various functions (mrca).
- Change height and length lenses.
- Combined calibrations and constraints.

** 0.5.0.0
- Marginal likelihood estimation using thermodynamic integration or stepping
  stone sampling.
- Various changes of function names (e.g., metropologis -> mhg).
- Updated examples.
- Proper but minimal logging framework.
- Various other changes.

** 0.4.0.0
- Greatly improve documentation.
- Major design change: Introduction of the =Algorithm= type class; algorithms
  are data types. See =MHG=.
- Metropolic-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (parallel chains).
- Optimal acceptance rate depends on dimension of proposal.
- Use a circular trace with constant memory usage (big change).
- Therefore, batch monitors use vectors now.
- Always save chain with complete trace (but with sensible length).
- Determine necessary trace length at initialization.
- Rename =Item= to =Link=.
- Rename =Status= to =Chain= and separate =Settings= and =Environment= from the
  =Chain=.
- Many bug fixes.

** 0.3.0
- New shorter example/test for dating trees.
- =noData= allows running a chain without likelihood function.
- Give proposal parameters =PName=, =PDescription=, and =PWeight= newtype
  wrappers.
- Give =Tune= a data type.
- Allow periodical cleansing of state (=Cleaner=).
- Add description string to proposals, so that they can be identified in an
  easier way.
- Add simplices and proposals on simplices.
- =slideUniform= renamed to =slideUniformSymmetric=.
- Merge tools into internal.
- Do not export internal modules.

** 0.2.4
- *Change order of arguments for proposals*.
- 'slideStem' was renamed to 'slideBranch'.
- Change ProposalSimple from newtype to type.
- Contravariant instances of parameter and batch monitors. Use =(>$<)= instead
  of =(@.)= and =(@#)=.
- Add =gammaDirichlet= prior for partitioned dating analyses.

** 0.2.3
- Contrary proposals.
- Change how monitors are lifted (use normal function, not a lens).
- Priors.
- Remove concurrent monitors (was slow).
- Improve MCMC sampler output.

** 0.2.2
- Move away from hpack.

** 0.2.1
- Consistently use ByteString instead of Text.
- Verbosity levels.
- Improved handling of proposals, moves, and monitors.
- Bactrian moves.
- Many small changes.

** 0.1.3
Many changes; notably it is now possible to continue a Markov chain run.
