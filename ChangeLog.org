* Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling - ChangeLog
** Unreleased changes
- New shorter example/test for dating trees.
- =noData= allows running a chain without likelihood function.
- Give proposal parameters =PName=, =PDescription=, and =PWeight= newtype
  wrappers.
- Give =Tune= a data type.
- Allow periodical cleansing of state (=Cleaner=).
- Add description string to proposals, so that they can be identified in an
  easier way.
- Add simplices and proposals on simplices.
- =slideUniform= renamed to =slideUniformSymmetric=.
- Merge tools into internal.
- Do not export internal modules.

** 0.2.4
- *Change order of arguments for proposals*.
- 'slideStem' was renamed to 'slideBranch'.
- Change ProposalSimple from newtype to type.
- Contravariant instances of parameter and batch monitors. Use =(>$<)= instead
  of =(@.)= and =(@#)=.
- Add =gammaDirichlet= prior for partitioned dating analyses.

** 0.2.3
- Contrary proposals.
- Change how monitors are lifted (use normal function, not a lens).
- Priors.
- Remove concurrent monitors (was slow).
- Improve MCMC sampler output.

** 0.2.2
- Move away from hpack.

** 0.2.1
- Consistently use ByteString instead of Text.
- Verbosity levels.
- Improved handling of proposals, moves, and monitors.
- Bactrian moves.
- Many small changes.

** 0.1.3
Many changes; notably it is now possible to continue a Markov chain run.
